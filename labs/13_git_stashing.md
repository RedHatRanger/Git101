# Main Lab

<br><br>
1. Help Sarah stash her current changes before heading over to the master branch to fix the typo:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be845bf-8eda-4fab-a49c-476ec7173e45)

```
git stash
git stash list
```
<br><br>
2. Now Sarah can checkout the master branch to fix the typo in `lion-and-mouse.txt`:

```
cd story-blog
git checkout main
vim lion-and-mouse.txt
git add lion-and-mouse.txt
git commit -m "Fixed title error"
```

<br><br>
3. Now let's move the stashed commit back to the staging area:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffe3960b-3287-4d22-94a4-4a971aa645c7)
```
git checkout story/frogs-and-ox
git stash list
git stash pop stash@{0}
```

<br><br>
4. Find the list of stories that were stashed:

>There are 3 stashed stories!

<br><br>
5. Figure out what files were stashed:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/203e6e4d-fb5c-4642-ba40-17b90a8cfab7)
```
git stash show stash@{0} ; git stash show stash@{1}; git stash show stash@{2}
```
>Answer: story3.txt, story2.txt, and story1.txt

* Done!
