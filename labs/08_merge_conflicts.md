# Main Lab
1. Max stages `story-index.txt` and commits the file successfully:
```
git add story-index.txt 
git commit -m "Add index of stories"
```

<br><br>
2. However, Max gets rejected when he pushes the changes to the remote repository:
```
git push -u origin master
```

>This error states that there is work on the remote repository that doesn't exist locally yet.

<br><br>
3. So we have to do a `git pull origin master` or `git pull` but the conflict is there:

```
git log origin/master

<br><br>
4. Modify the `story-index.txt` file:
```
cat << EOF > story-index.txt
1. The Lion and the Mouse
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog
EOF
```
