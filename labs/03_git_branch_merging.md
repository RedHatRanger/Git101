### **Objectives**
By completing this lab, you will:  

1. **Switch Between Branches**  
   - Learn how to navigate between different branches using `git checkout`.  

2. **Identify Existing Branches**  
   - Use `git branch` to check the number of branches in a repository.  

3. **Review Commit History**  
   - Understand how to inspect the commit history of multiple branches using `git log`.  

4. **Merge a Feature Branch into Master**  
   - Perform a branch merge using `git merge` to integrate changes from a feature branch into the main branch.  

This lab will reinforce core Git skills essential for managing version control in collaborative workflows. ðŸš€


1. Switch back to master branch:
```
git checkout master
```

2. How many branches?  There are two:
```
git branch
# Output:
# * master
#   story/frogs-and-ox
```

3. Let's check git log:
```
# The new story Sarah wrote is in the story/frogs-and-ox branch. It's time to merge the branch and bring it to the master branch.
# But before that look at the log of the master and story/frogs-and-ox branches and identify how many commits there have been in the past on each branch.

git log master
git log story/frogs-and-ox
```

4. Time to merge the `story/frogs-and-ox` branch with `master`:
```
git merge story/frogs-and-ox -m "Merge branch 'story/frogs-and-ox'"
```




## Summary
In this lab, you practiced switching between branches, reviewing commit history, and merging branches in Git.

#### 1. **Switching to the Master Branch**  
   - You started by switching back to the `master` branch using:
     ```bash
     git checkout master
     ```

#### 2. **Checking Available Branches**  
   - You verified that there were two branches:  
     - `master` (the main branch)  
     - `story/frogs-and-ox` (a feature/story branch)

   - To list branches, you used:
     ```bash
     git branch
     ```

#### 3. **Reviewing Commit History**  
   - Before merging, you inspected the commit history of both branches using:
     ```bash
     git log master
     git log story/frogs-and-ox
     ```
   - This helped in identifying the number of commits made on each branch.

#### 4. **Merging the Branch**  
   - Finally, you merged the `story/frogs-and-ox` branch into `master` using:  
     ```bash
     git merge story/frogs-and-ox -m "Merge branch 'story/frogs-and-ox'"
     ```
   - This incorporated all the changes from the feature branch into the main branch.

By completing this lab, you have learned how to navigate branches, check commit history, and perform a branch mergeâ€”essential skills for collaborative Git workflows.
