## Quick Review of Previous Labs
- **Lab 2**: We learned about **branches**—little paths off of the main path.
- **Lab 3**: We learned about **merging** those branches back together.

Now, in **Lab 4**, we want to **share** our project with friends or classmates. We do this by pushing our files to an **online place** called a **remote** (like GitHub). Think of it as putting your project in a **safe online box** where everyone can grab it!

---

## What is a Remote?
A **remote** is an online copy of your Git project. You can **push** (send) your changes to the remote so others can see them. You can also **pull** (download) changes if someone else made updates in the remote.

---

## Objectives
1. **Add a remote** to connect your local (computer) project to an online place.
2. **Push** your local changes so they appear in the remote.
3. **Pull** changes from the remote if others have updated the code.
4. Learn how to make **new branches** that also live on the remote.
5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

---

## I. Adding a Remote
1. **Make a new repository on GitHub** (or another website). Call it **`story-blog`**.
2. Copy the link (URL) of that repo (like `https://github.com/your-name/story-blog.git`).
3. In your local project folder:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-name/story-blog.git
```

4. Check it worked:
```bash
git remote -v
```
This shows **where** your remote is.

---

## II. Pushing Changes

### First Push
```bash
git push -u origin master
```
- **`-u origin master`** means “Set the main branch (`master`) to upload to `origin` (the remote).”
- Enter your username/password if asked.
>Tip: to avoid having to type in the credentials each time, consider adding your local machine's SSH keys to GitHub or Gitea

### After That
```bash
git push
```
This is all you need, because Git remembers where to send your changes.

### Check Online
Go to GitHub and look at your `story-blog` repo. You should see your files—like `lion-and-mouse.txt` and `frogs-and-ox.txt`—from the earlier labs.

---

## III. Pulling Changes
If your friend or teammate **fixes** something on GitHub, you want those fixes on your computer too. So you do:

```bash
git pull
```

This gets the newest stuff from the remote and **merges** it into your local code.

---

## IV. Remote-Tracking Branches
If you make a **brand new branch** on your computer, you might want it to show up online, too.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-ui
# Make a new branch

git push -u origin feature/new-ui
# Connect it to the remote
```

Now your local `feature/new-ui` branch is linked with `origin/feature/new-ui`. When you **push** or **pull**, Git knows they go together.

<br><br>
## V. Frequently Asked Questions
## What Does `git push -u origin main` Mean?

### Breaking It Down:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

This command does a few things:

1. **`git push`** – This sends your saved changes to a storage place on the internet (like GitHub).
2. **`-u`** – This tells Git to remember where to send future changes.
3. **`origin`** – This is the nickname for the online storage place (GitHub, for example).
4. **`main`** – This is the name of the branch (like a folder) where your changes go.

### What Happens When You Run This?
- If the `main` branch doesn’t exist online yet, this makes it.
- It remembers where to send future updates, so you don’t have to type as much next time.
- Next time, you can just type `git push` or `git pull`, and Git will know what to do!

### When Would You Use This?
If you just started using Git and made a change, running:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

will send your changes to GitHub and set it up so you can easily send more changes later.

---

## Does `git clone` Automatically Set `origin`?

If you **copy** a project from GitHub using:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Git **automatically remembers** where it came from, so you **don’t** need to type:

```bash
git remote add origin <http link>
```

### How Do You Check If Git Remembers?

After copying, check by typing:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like this:

```
origin  https://github.com/username/repository.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/repository.git (push)
```

That means Git knows where your project lives online.

### When Would You Need `git remote add origin`?
You only need to do this if:
1. You started a project on your computer using `git init` instead of copying one.
2. You accidentally removed the connection and need to add it again.
3. You want to change where your project is saved online (use `git remote set-url origin <new_url>` for that).

---

## Summary
- **Add a remote** so Git knows where your code lives online.
- **Push** to share your updates.
- **Pull** to get updates from others.
- **Remote-tracking branches** let new branches live online, too.

With **remotes**, everyone can work on the same code from different computers, all at once. No more emailing files back and forth!
