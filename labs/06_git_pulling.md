># The Setup
>- Be sure you still have the repo you cloned earlier from Lab 5.

# Main Lab
1. Let's create a new branch that max can work on safely without touching the main branch:
```
git checkout -b story/fox-and-grapes
```

<br><br>
2. Make a slight change to the `fox-and-grapes.txt`, stage, then commit to the new branch:
```
git add fox-and-grapes.txt 
git commit -m "Updated fox-and-grapes story"
```

<br><br>
3. Push the committed changes to the new remote branch:
```
git push -u origin story/fox-and-grapes

# You will have to enter the password if you didn't add SSH keys in GitHub
```

<br><br>
4. Access GitHub, GitBucket, or Gitea's UI portal to submit a Pull Request (PR) to merge the changes to master:
```
PR title : Added fox-and-grapes story

PR pull from branch: story/fox-and-grapes (source)

PR merge into branch: master (destination)

Add tom as reviewer through the Git Portal UI
```

> It should look something like this when you are finished:

<br><br>
5. Tom can now review the changes when he logs in and merge the changes as necessary.
