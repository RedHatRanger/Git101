## 1. Cloning or Using an Existing Repo

- **Using an Existing Repo:**  
  If you have an existing repository from **Lab 1**, simply navigate to that folder.

- **Cloning a New Repo:**  
  Otherwise, clone a sample repository from GitHub:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/githubteacher/example-basic.git
  cd example-basic
  ```
