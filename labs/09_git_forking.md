2. Now Jon makes some changes to the Fox and Grapes Story:
```
cat << EOF > fox-and-grapes.txt
--------------------------------------------
      THE FOX AND GRAPES
--------------------------------------------

A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree.

The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.

The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it.

The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way.

So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more.

Again and again he tried, but in vain.

Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.

"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."

And off he walked very, very scornfully.
